## Create a Report

You can use the [command line](/wiki/usage) to perform a diagnosis of your workspace and export the results to a file. This report will use the [`.luarc.json`](/wiki/configuration#luarcjson-file) in the target workspace (unless otherwise specified with [`--configpath`](/wiki/usage#--configpath))

The command should look like this:

`lua-language-server --check E:\programming\myLuaProject --checklevel=Warning`

{/* TODO: Update link to log file info */}
The server will exit once the report is complete. The report will be written to `check.json` in your [logpath](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/FAQ#where-can-i-find-the-log-file) (unless otherwise specified with [`--logpath`](/wiki/usage#--logpath)).

## How it Works

The check command will start a virtual client that opens all files in the target workspace, retrieves all diagnostic info, and writes it to a file.

<Remark type="note">
  Since each file is being opened, `"Opened"` has the same effect as `"Any"` for
  [`Lua.diagnostics.neededFileStatus`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsneededfilestatus)
  and
  [`Lua.diagnostics.groupFileStatus`](/wiki/settings#diagnosticsneededfilestatus).
